## Welcome!

## Running Code

-   **R**- a programming language used for statistical computing and data analysis.\
-   **RStudio**- an integrated development environment (IDE) that uses R language. It is one of the most popular R language editors, and the one we will be using throughout this workshop!\
-   **Base R**- Everything you automatically get when you first install R.
-   **Posit**- the company that was formerly named "RStudio" that created the RStudio IDE, and has since expanded its functions to so much more

```{r}
library(knitr)
```

## 1. Getting Started

Let's start by writing our first code! We will be using RStudio throughout this course. Start by launching RStudio.\
*Note*- If you don't know where RStudio was installed, simply type it in the Search Bar on the bottom left part of your Desktop (see below). Click the RStudio icon to launch.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/finding_rstudio.png")
```

Once you launch RStudio, your screen should look something like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio_terminal.png")
```

-   **Console**- The pane on the **left**, where you can type and execute code.
-   **Environment**- The pane on the **top-right**, an easy place to see your workspace. This is where all of your objects/variable values get stored. \n
-   **Other Panes**- Everything else! More on this later.

There are two ways we can write code- by typing directly in the console, and by writing it into a new **script**. We will be writing our code as scripts throughout this workshop since it will allow us to keep our work **clean**, **organized**, and **saved**.

### 1.1 Our First Script

Like many tasks in R, there are two ways to make a new script- by using the RStudio interface and by using the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+Enter on Windows). We will be using the RStudio interface for most of this workshop, but if you are interested in using the Keyboard Shortcuts you can see a more comprehensive list *here*.

***Let's make a new script!*** On the top-left of your screen, click File, New File, then R Script.

This starts a new pane on the top left. This is where we can start writing our first code:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width= "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio_newscript.png")
```

Let's make sure to save our script- to do this, click on the save icon (or Ctrl+S). It will then prompt you to give it a name. Whenever you name a document, follow these three principals: it should be **machine readable, human readable, and play well with default ordering.** Avoid **spaces, punctuation, and accented characters**, and instead opt for hyphens or underscores.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/how_to_name_files.png")
```

Type in *my_first_script.R*. Click the Save button.

### Knowledge Check 1- Naming Conventions

## 2. Our First Code

Now that we have a blank script, let's get to coding!

### 2.1 Objects

*Object* describes stuff that is stored in R. Variables, functions, and dataframes are all objects.

Let's start by defining our first variable. Type the following code into your script, *my_first_script.R*:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
x <- 36

```

Now, run your code. You can click the "Run" button located on the top-right part of the console pane (or shortcut **Ctrl+Enter**).

Notice that R did not print anything. So, what has happened?

Since we defined our variable, x, as 36, we have told R to store the value 36 in the object x. Note that our environment now has our first object.

If you do want R to print the result, we can add the **print( )** function to our code. Type the following into your script:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
x <- 36

print(x)
```

Now, run your script again. Notice **36** is now printed in your console.

### 2.2 Functions

**Functions** are pieces of codes that accomplish a specific task. They exist in every programming language- for example, *SUM()* in Excel is a function that adds the specified columns you give it.

In R, we use parentheses to execute functions. **print()** which we just used above, is an example of this. **print** is the function, but we need to type parentheses after to tell R that it's a function.

R has many predefined functions that come automatically with installing it, but there are even more that we can add on using downloaded **packages**.

You can also write your own functions, but that can be covered in a later workshop. However, if you think of an operation you want to perform, there's a good chance it already exists!

### 2.3 Our First Dataset

This workshop will focus on learning through problem solving, so let's start by getting in some data to look at. Generally, when you use R, you will be loading in your own data. We regularly load in Excel files, CSV, SAS files, etc. here at EPA, just to name a few. We will cover how to load external datasets next session.

R also has some datasets that are built-in automatically. We will start by using the dataset **midwest** that is built-in the package **ggplot2**. Type the following code into your script:

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
data(midwest)
```

Notice "midwest" is now located in your environment. We can view this either by using code, or by clicking on the object within our environment.

Click on "midwest" in your Environment (remember- top right pane!). Notice this will show you the data in a new tab in our code editor.

We can also look at our data using code. There are a lot of lines, so I want to really just look at a piece of this code just to see what it looks like (what columns there are, what type of data is available, etc).

Type the following code into your script:

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
head(midwest)
```

Run that line of code- notice that it prints just the first 6 lines. This is because the function *head()* will always print the first 6 rows of any dataframe you pass to it. It's a very useful function, especially when you have real life data that can have thousands, or even millions, of rows.

### 2.4 Installing/Loading Packages

**Base R** is what you get automatically when you install R, but thousands of packages exist that we can install and add on. R makes this very easy.

Navigate to the "Tools" tab on the top left. Click Tools, Install Packages. This is one way to search and install packages- you can type the desired package in the middle line.

We can also install packages using the function **install.packages()**. Type the following in your script:

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results=FALSE,render=FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")

```

Run your script again. This now installed the package *dplyr* which is actually part of a family of packages referred to as the *Tidyverse*, which we will cover more extensively tomorrow during Day 2.

Let's try using a function from *dplyr* now that we installed it! *filter()* is a common function in this package- let's find out which counties in the midwest had a population total greater than **1,000,000** people.

Type the following code into your console:

```{r, echo=TRUE, error=TRUE}
midwest %>% filter(poptotal>1000000)
```

This will take the "midwest" data, and just show the counties that have a population *greater than* 1,000,000 people. Run the code.

What happened? This is our first (and certainly not last) error!

R could not find the function **%\>%** or **filter()** because, even though we *installed* **dplyr** we did not *load* it into our library!

Type the following into your script:

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

This now *loads* the package *dplyr* into our session. Note that you only need to *install* packages once- it will remain installed forever, and just needs to be loaded with the **library()** function.

To save us time in later sessions, we will install *all* of the packages we need for the rest of the workshop as part of our first exercise at the end of this session.

### 2.5 Commenting Your Code

The pound/hash key (#) in R is never evaluated when code is executed. We can use \# to write reminders and instructions to ourselves, which keeps our code clean and organized. Add the following to our script:

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Define x
x <- 36
print(x)

# Load midwest data
data("midwest")
head(midwest)

#Install/Load dplyr and filter
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
midwest %>% filter(poptotal>1000000)
```

Note that we haven't changed any of our code, we just commented out to make it clean and easy to read!

## Activity 1!

## 3. Data Types

Variables in R can be of different **types**. The function **class()** helps us determine what type of object we have. Add the following code to our script:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
class(x)

```

Run the two new lines of code. Our object, *x*, is of type **numeric**. We will talk more about what that means next.

### 3.1 Data frames

Data frames are the most common way to store datasets in R. You can think of a data frame as a table with rows and columns of data. Note- data frames are a type of object, but each *column* in a dataframe also has a different data type.

Type the following code into our script:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
class(midwest)
```

Run the code. Notice that "midwest" is, indeed, a data frame.

### 3.2 Examining Data

There are many different ways to examine data- we have actually already learned some of them! **head()**, which we covered earlier, is one example. Let's go over three of the most common ways using "midwest" again.

Type the following again into our script:

```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hide', warning=FALSE}
head(midwest)
```

Run the code to remind yourself what **head()** will print. Now, add the following code to our script:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
str(midwest)
```

Run the new line of code. The function **str()** also allows us to examine our data, but unlike **head()** it gives us more information about the *structure* of our object. Note that we have learned "midwest" has 430 rows and 28 columns. We also learned the data type of each column- for example, the "poptotal" column is of type integer (int) and the "area" column is of type numeric (num).

The other common way to examine data is to simply click on the object in our Environment Pane. Click on "midwest" on the top right. Notice this opens a new tab in our Code Editor, and allows us to view the entire dataframe all at once. This is a great option for dataframes of this size, but can sometimes make R slow down when dealing with big datasets. The same thing can also be accomplished using the function **View()**.

### 3.3 The Accessor \$

To access columns inside a dataframe, we use the symbol \$, also called the **accessor**.

Type the following into our script:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
midwest$county
```

Run the new line. Note that it prints the "county" column, which is inside the "midwest" dataframe.

*Tip 1*: If you forget your column names, R can suggest them for you by hitting the **Tab** button. Try typing **midwest\$**, and immediately hit Tab. This will show you all of the column names that exist inside the "midwest" dataframe, and we can toggle between them using the arrow keys on the keyboard.

### 3.4 Vectors: Numerics, Characters, Logicals

The columns of midwest are not just one number/word, but are 430. Each column is a different *vector*, and vectors in R can be of different types. Three of which are: **numeric, character, or logical**.

#### Numeric

Type the following code into your script:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
class(midwest$area)

```

Run the code. Notice that the "area" vector is of type **numeric**. This makes sense, since all of the values in this column are numbers.

#### Character

Type the following code into your script"

```{r, echo=TRUE}
class(midwest$state)

```

Run the code. Notice that the vector "State" is a character vector. Character vectors contain all characters.

#### Logical

The final type of vector is called a **logical** vector. Logical vectors store values that are either **true** or **false**.

Type the following code into your script:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
midwest$state == "WI"

```

Run the code. Note that R prints a **logical vector** of TRUEs and FALSEs.

**length()** is a function that gives the length of a vector, and is commonly used- when paired with other functions, the **TRUEs** are counted as 1's, and the **FALSEs** are counted as 0s. Try adding the following code to our script:

```{r length, echo=TRUE}
length(which(midwest$state == "WI"))
```

### Knowledge Check 2

We asked R to evaluate the "state" vector, whereby any value in the "state" vector that equals "WI" will be **TRUE** and everything else will be **FALSE** (since it does not equal "WI"). **The which()** function evaluated which rows equal "WI", or in other words, converted our **TRUEs** to 1's. **length** then counted up our 1's.

Note- this is an example of a function inside of a function, also called *nesting*. The general convention is *function_1(function_2())*

**==** in R is a relational operator- basically it asks R "Does x equal y?". **3 == 2** asks R, does 3 equal 2? Try typing this in your console. You will note R prints **FALSE**.

*Tip 2*: You may now notice that **==**, **=**, and **\<-** are all valid in R but do different things. **==** is relational, and is comparing two values. In contrast, **=** and **\<-** both assign variables. **=** and **\<-** actually do the same thing, but I recommend sticking to **\<-**. More on that later.

### 3.5 Factors

Now, load in another dataset that's built-in to base R, and view the first six lines:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
data("iris")
head(iris)
```

### Knowledge Check 3: What type do you think the Species column is?

Type the following code into your script:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
class(iris$Species)

```

Note that the column is of type **factor** even though it looks exactly like a character vector.

Factors are another data type, and are useful when storing categorical data. It looks exactly the same as a numeric or character vector to us, but is different to R. In the background, R stores factors as *levels*. *Levels* are basically labels that divide the data into different categories.

Type the following code into your script:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
levels(iris$Species)
```

Note that even though the vector is 150 entries long, but there are only 3 levels. This is more memory efficient and can be useful for large datasets. For our purposes, we will not need to use them much. This is where the following functions can be useful:

-   as.character() *converts vector to a character vector*

-   as.numeric() *converts vector to a numeric vector*

## 4. Troubleshooting

### 4.1 ? Function

Every function in R has a help page that can be accessed right in RStudio. We can access this by using the symbol **?**. Type the following code **directly into your console** (not in your script):

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
?filter
```

Note that this generates the help page for the *filter()* function. This is in the bottom right pane under the "Help" tab. You can do this with any function.\
Another way to access the Help page is by going to Help, Search R Help on the top left. This will do the same thing- just type the function you are looking for.

### 4.2 RStudio Cheatsheets and Global Options

Many packages and topics in R have user-friendly cheatsheets which are a great resource. Some are written by Posit (formerly RStudio) and others are made by R users from all over the world.

If you navigate to "Help" in the top-left corner of your screen, and select "Cheat Sheets" you will find many of the most popular ones! The "RStudio IDE Cheat Sheet" gives a nice general overview of some of what we touched on today, and also includes shortcuts that can save coders time. I have one copy printed at my desk for this reason!

### 4.3 Arguments

The code that goes inside functions is called **arguments**. Each function in R has certain **arguments** that it is expecting, and some arguments that are optional.

If you ever forget what the arguments of a specific function are, there are a few things you can do: \* Use the ? or help() function in your Console \* Use the **args()** function, which will print the arguments \* Type your function in the console and then click TAB- you can toggle between arguments with the arrow keys

### 4.4 Errors

Errors are not only common when coding, but are inevitable- even for the most advanced R users.

This is by no means comprehensive, but if you do run into errors here are some common mistakes: \* Capitalization \* Misspelling \* Punctuation (forgetting commas, not closing parentheses, forgetting + or %\>%) \* Packages (forgetting to install and/or load a package. Don't forget **library()**)

### 4.5 Google/StackOverflow

A coders best friend is Google- if you run into an error you're not sure about and have tried the above methods, try Googling it. Chances are someone else has already had the same problem! Twitter/X is also a popular place for R users to ask questions under the hashtag #RStats

Google tip- Although we love **R**, it can often confuse the internet since it's a single letter. Try Googling "R (insert error)", but if you can't find what you're looking for, also try "R language (insert error)"

### 4.6 More Organization Tips

We touched a little bit on naming conventions, which is one way to help keep code organized while we work. Another useful tool is using the "Projects" feature. On the top-right of your screen, just above the Environment, you should see a dropdown option- if you click on this, you'll see "New Project". Projects are one way to help separate code from different projects you may be working on, and can further increase organization.

## Activity 2!
